What are Chef and Puppet

Chef, the configuration management tool makes automation possible across several devices and servers with not many steps to follow. It uses a declarative approach to coding and hence removes the demand of creating pages of codes. Just in few clicks one can deploy as well as manage all the software applications in all devices across the business. This makes life easy as there is no need for professionals to know hardcore coding. One can kick start a career with minimal knowledge in coding. That is the power of this automation tool. The only requirement to start with the chef is to know Ruby DSL language basics which will also be taught in every DevOps online course.

Puppet centralizes and automates the configuration management process within no time. It is available in an open-source version allowing anyone to learn and make use of it. Puppet will individually configure each host and monitors continuously all the configurations. Yes, irrespective of the number of servers puppet does it easily. Further, it has control over many infrastructures and is used for deploying several applications in servers automatically.  Puppet also uses declarative-specific language (DSL) and defines the attributes of each environment.


S.No  Criteria      Chef             Puppet
1	Replacement in the event of failure  	The backup server can replace the chef-server 	An alternate master can be replaced for a failed    master which is active 
2	The language used for configuration	Ruby DSL	Puppet DSL or Embedded Ruby
3	Installation time and ease	It is time-consuming and complex	Comparatively easy still takes time due to certificate signing between the agent and the master 
4	Accessibility 	Only accessible to chef clients for configuration	Puppet clients can configure for master machine and client machine 
5	Scalability	Massive codes make it difficult for scalable deployments	Large Puppet codes are difficult to creating scalability issues 
6	Platforms Run on
Windows, enterprise Linux distributions, Cisco IO, Solaris, Nexus, AIX and AWS	Red Had Linux, Debian, Windows Server OS, Windows Consumer OS 10, Mac 10.12
7	Concepts 
Chef uses cookbooks and recipes to describe generic concepts	Puppet uses manifest to describe single concepts 
8	Price	The annual fee for chef automation is close to USD 140 with which build and deployment can be done	Puppet annual fee ranges between USD 110 and 199 for standard and premium plan
9	Skills required 
Strong programming skills are required to make chef your best friend	System administrators will easily learn the knack to use Puppet 
10	Product capability	
Configuration automation Role-based access control
